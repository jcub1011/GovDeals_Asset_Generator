<br><br><p style="color:red"><u><b>SALES TAX</u></b></p> 
When applicable, sales tax is calculated based upon the auction’s advertised location.<br><br>
If you are seeking sales tax exemption, you must complete Liquidity Services’ tax exemption form(s). 
We recommend doing this prior to the auction’s closure or before making payment.
